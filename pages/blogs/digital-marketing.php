            <p>It has been around for a while, and easily one of the most popular term in the 
            world of corporate businesses. It is the go-to for Entrepreneurs 
            and business owners who wishes to experience upsurge in business growth and

            </p>

            <p>
            Gone are the days when the focus was to produce the killer product&#8212;
            that quickly became the darlings of consumers. The focus 
            was all too narrow: produce quality products that will eventually sell itself. Such
            orientation, though, not bad all, its scope was alarmingly 
            inadequate&#8212;atleast for today's hectic and heavily competitive business 
            environment.</p>
            <p> Our society as we know it has changed, with competition for 
            brand identity and dominance reaching unprecedented level. Billions of
            dollars are spent annually on advertising and other related digital
            marketing activities. With a shift in focus, came the 
            popularization of the buzzword: "digital marketting", which
            first began to gather momentum in the early 2000s.
          </p>
          <p>
           Digital marketing no doubt, have been around for a while,
           with some famous inventions which had at their core elements
           that resembles the digital marketing activities that we
            practice today. A good example is a story told by Nell
            Patel, a seasoned writer and a digital marketing expert: In his
            post on the subject, he wrote of a famous inventor in
            Guglielmo Marconi&#8212;
            who invented the very first radio, and its maiden usage was
            to broadcast an advertisement about an  upcoming opera performance. 
            This experiment by the creator was an instant success;
             tickets were bought is response to the advertisement.
              A new media was born.</p>
              <p>
            Also in the spirit of invention,  Ray Tomlinson in 1971 developed
            a technology which  enabled him to send the very first  email&#8212;
            today email is one of the most powerful media for driving revenue.
            </p>
            <p>
             In recent times, the term digital marketing has become 
             even broader, as new strategies are constantly being
              incorporated into the digital marketing space, arriving 
              at a general, organic definition nowadays, often seemed difficult,
               as various digital marketers 
              perceives the term slightly differently, and will  
              arbitrarily add other new concepts into an already 
              convoluted  term.
            </p>
            <p>For starters, In my opinion, the below definition of digital marketing
                will suffix.
            </p>
            <p class="def">
               <em> Digital Marketing is an umbrella term for a group of carefully planned 
                activities that targets electronic devices as a medium for reaching more 
                potential customers.</em>
            </p
            <p>Yea, electronic devices!&#8212;they are the soul of digital marketing.
            </p>
            <p>The concept of digital marketing&#8212;at a narrow perspective may be 
                perceived as a form of advertisement that leverages the Internet
                as a media for reaching new customers. This view
                however, would be tempting to subscribe to since the Internet
                has become overly scalable and the volume of digital marketing 
                activities it enables continue to increase.
            </p> 
            <p>Digital marketing aren't that bare. It is a colossus&#8212; with many
                layers. Just asked one of those digital marketing experts,
                trust me, you will be overwhelmed by how much concepts
                you'll have to absorb. </p>
                <p>
                Holistically, digital marketing is a core business function
                aimed at bolstering  brand identity, lead generation,
                customer satisfaction, and drive revenue through an assortment of 
                strategies that leverages electronic devices.
                </p>
                 <p>
                Technology keep advancing, and with it comes new opportunity
                for marketers to bond with potential customers.
                over the years, while the Internet have become very easily 
                accessible, in similar token, marketers have been very
                 busy. They created the perfect strategies: to engage potential
                customers, meeting them&#8212;at the very point of their needs, at the 
                places where they spend more of their time. Guess where? (the Internet). Marketer that good.
                </p>
                <p>Digital marketing can be grouped into two main categories:
                 offline marketing and online marketing.
                </p>
                
                <h3>Offline marketing</h3>
                Offline marketing form some of the most important aspects of 
                digital marketing. They are those activities that does 
                not involves the use of the Internet, yet provide some important
                channels for marketers to explore.
                This kind of marketing campaign leverages simple channels
                some of which are: 
                <ul class="post-list-items sm-btm-mgn">
                    <li>SMS and MMS</li>
                    <li>Phone calls</li>
                    <li>Radio Ads</li>
                    <li>Television Ads</li>
                    <li>Electronic billboards</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Offline marketing is often underestimated partly because the channels involved'
                    re somewhat traditional. Remember the famous radio broadcast by
                    Guglielmo Marconi right? Before the Internet became ever so popular,
                    offline marketing in the form of billboards, tvs and radio ads
                     were at the heart of advertisement and marketing. </p>
                    <p>Contrary to the fear that it is dying, Tv ads
                    still commands a seizable amount of all marketing spend worldwide. As a matter 
                    of fact, Tv has always been the real deal, only recently eclipsed by the
                    Internet. Frankly, given the steady improvement in Internet enabled
                    technologies and devices,
                     it was only a matter of time. But Tv is still doing well
                    worldwide. The industry brought in about $178 billion dollars last year.
                    This figure is expected to go even higher in 2018, with major
                    sporting events like the Fifa world cup in Russia and the Winter
                    Olympics in Pyongyang, South Korea.
                </p>
                <p>Yes, Tv is great&#8212;but it is also very expensive. A 30-second super
                Bowl commercial costs at least $5 million according to Sports illustrated. 
                 <br>Can you believe that? </p>
                 <p>Small businesses and start ups will no doubt
                 struggle. But all hope is not lost, thanks to the versatility of digital
                  marketing. texting and phone calls also provides good opportunities for business owners to bond with potential 
                  customers.
                <p>By now, no doubt, you will agree with me that offline marketing
                    presents as much lead growth opportunity as its online
                    counterpart with multiple channels to explore.
                </p>
